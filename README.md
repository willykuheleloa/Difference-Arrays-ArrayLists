Difference-Arrays-ArrayLists Project
🚀 Introduction
Welcome to the Difference-Arrays-ArrayLists project! This repository is not just a piece of code; it's a journey into the heart of Java's data structures. Here, we explore the intriguing world of Arrays and ArrayLists, understanding their quirks, features, and use-cases.

🌟 Arrays vs. ArrayLists in Java
🔹 Arrays: The Classic Hero
Definition: A humble but powerful data structure, an array is a container holding a fixed number of elements, all of the same type.
Superpower: Lightning-fast access! Thanks to its index-based system, fetching an element is a piece of cake (or an array of cakes, if you will).
But Remember: With great power comes a fixed size. Decide its length wisely!
🔸 ArrayLists: The Dynamic Maverick
Definition: Part of Java's Collections Framework, ArrayLists are like arrays, but with a twist — they can grow and shrink as needed.
Superpower: Flexibility is the name of the game. Add or remove elements without a sweat.
But Remember: This flexibility comes with a tiny overhead. A small price for being dynamic!
