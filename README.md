# Difference Between Arrays and ArrayLists in Java

## Arrays in Java

Arrays are a way to store a set of items where:
- All items are of the same type (like all numbers or all words).
- The number of items (the size of the array) is decided when you create the array and can't be changed later.
- You can access any item quickly if you know its position in the array.

Example of an Array:
```java
int[] numbers = new int[5]; // An array that can hold 5 numbers
